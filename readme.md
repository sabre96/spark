# Recruitment

A Lilopel private project.
When cloning copy .env.example and change it to .env and edit to your liking
and run `composer install` => `artisan key:generate`. Finally run `artisan migrate`

Tip: also run `composer require barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper` 
=> `artisan ide-helper:generate` for PHPStorm Laravel support.

(Laravel plugin needed too, and enabled: https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2015/01/laravel-development-using-phpstorm/)
